Given two numbers A and B. Perform addition, subtraction, division and multiplication on these two numbers and display result in a new line.

Input: First line of the input contains an integer T which denotes the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.  Each test case contains a single line containing two space separated integers A and B. 

Output: There should be four lines of output for each test case. Description of the 4 lines is shown below:
First Line:  Result of addition of the two numbers
Second Line: Result of subtracting the smaller number from the greater number.
Third Line: Result of dividing greater number by the smaller number (Result will be in integer)
Fourth Line: Result of multiplication of the two numbers. 

Constraints:
1 <= T< = 100
1<=A<=1000
1<=B<=1000

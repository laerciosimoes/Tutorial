Given an integer, check whether it is a palindrome or not.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N to be checked for palindrome.

Output:
Print "Yes" or "No" (without quotes) depending on whether the number is palindrome or not.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 10000

Example:
Input:
